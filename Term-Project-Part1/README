I followed the BeeJ tutorial and finished a socket programming assignment
My code files are servermain.cc and client.cc. The makefile is Makefile. Servermain.cc can handle multiple clients at the same time. Client.cc can send and receive messages from server. I also wrote a makefile to compile the program.
I put all the messages inside a buffer and send them to the server. Different information such as clientID and department names will be separated by semicolon
I haven't found any
